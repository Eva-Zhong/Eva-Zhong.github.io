Do you like the game 2048? If you do, take a look at our modified version of 2048! In an Intro to Java course, my teammate and I developed a rotating version of 2048. Yes, the board rotates! This makes the game more fun and challenging. You can't always control what happens happens after your next move.

We put our board against the galaxy to add a sense of mysteriousness.

There are three levels in this game. The first level is the same as the original game. In the second level, when the users reach a certain score, the board will turn and the tiles will drop down as if they are pulled by GRAVITY in space.

In the third level, not only will the board rotate, but tiles with the same value will be subtracted from (instead of added with) each other.
