Thank you for stopping by! This is Eva. I am a senior at Carnegie Mellon University studying Statistics and Machine Learning, with a Computer Science Minor.

Besides my coursework, I enjoy learning about Natural Language Processing, and I work as a student researcher at Language Technology Institute at CMU.

I believe identifying the right problem to solve is as important as implementing the solution, and I am passionate about utilizing my skillset in Data Science and programming to solve problems that matter.

If you share similar interests as me, I would love to connect with you! Feel free to connect with me on Linkedin or drop me a message.
